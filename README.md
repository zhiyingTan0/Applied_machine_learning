## Project 1: COVID-19 cases prediction
* Predicted by using KNN and Decision tree algorithm
* Data Visualization (PCA and K means clustreting)


## Project 2: Optimization and SGD
* Choose dataset from openML: digits, cars
* Manually implement the SGD and logistic regression model to  make a prediction
* optimize the hyperparameter with grid search algorithm

## Project 3
